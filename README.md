# Recyclegram
Recyclegram is an app to safely dispose of non-biodegradable materials at the comfort of our home.

Problem Statement:
* Not all non- biodegradable wastes are being recycled, leading them to be disposed in landfills, which leads to them piling up or being disposed in harmful ways, thus polluting air, land and/or water
* Citizens are not aware of the various means by which such materials can be safely discarded,

Our solution: 
* Customers can request waste pickups through the app citing their address, type of waste and its picture (optional). 
* Workers can see these requests, schedule an appointment and pre-inform the customers that they will be picking up at that specifiic time.
* Payment on the spot through online payment or COD
* Store selling biodegradable alternatives to everyday items cutlery and bowls, carry bags, cleaning products etc. are reasonable rates
